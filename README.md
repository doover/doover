- 👋 Hi, I’m @doover
- 👀 I’m interested in - getting a decent night's sleep.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning - Finally getting around to trying to learn Jenkins (if my IT department lets me get access to our Jenkins server).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on - nothing in particular at the moment.
- 📫 How to reach me - nowhere at the moment.
